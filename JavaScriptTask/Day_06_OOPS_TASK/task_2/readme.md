# TypeScript to JavaScript Conversion and Execution

This repository contains TypeScript files that need to be converted to JavaScript and executed. Follow the steps below to convert TypeScript (.ts) files to JavaScript (.js) and run them.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and TypeScript installed on your system. If not, you can download and install them from the following links:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Conversion Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/qureshiowais91/portfolio/tree/master/JavaScriptTask/Day_06_OOPS_TASK
   ```
   Replace `your-username` and `your-repo` with your GitHub username and repository name.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```
   cd your-repo
   ```
   Change `your-repo` to the name of your cloned repository.

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   This command installs the required dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.

4. **Convert TypeScript to JavaScript:**
   ```
   tsc
   ```
   The TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) will compile the TypeScript files (`.ts`) into JavaScript files (`.js`) based on the configurations specified in the `tsconfig.json` file.

5. **Run the JavaScript Files:**
   ```
   node filename.js
   ```
   Replace `filename.js` with the name of the JavaScript file you want to run. This command executes the JavaScript file using Node.js.
